		<p><u>Job title:</u> IT admin / software manager<br><u>Job Demand:</u> Medium High<br>
		<u>Required General Skill Set:</u> Communication / problem solving / organising teams /Time management / Leaderships / MS basic tasks<br>
		<u>Required IT Skill Set:</u> Fluent in many coding languages / familiarised with data management / System Admin Softwares / Building Networks / Basic cybersecurity
	<p>Many of this position’s required IT-specific skills are created through years of learning and working experience. Some of these skills like programming languages may be usual for many people looking for a job, but all these skills combine into a highly demanded skill set where most people don’t include all.</p>
	<p>The required general skills are built upon working experience with people. These managing and people mastery skills are not common since not everyone is born a leader. These skills are trained for years which is not easy to achieve, causing these skills to become highly demanded skills. Some most in-demand IT skills in 2021 that are not required to be an IT administrator include AI, VR, and blockchain.</p>
	<p>As for some most needed general skills in 2021, including UX design, Sales, and translation, are not mandatory when applying to be an IT admin. After looking at these articles and statistics, I’m more sure about my ideal job since these are crucial to the market in the future and will gain me a big fortune compared to most other jobs. Although being an IT administrator takes years of training and hard-work, I still want to strive for it and grind for that bright future.</p>

	<p><u>Job title:</u> Machine Learning Engineer<br>
		<u>Job demand:</u> High<br>
		<u>Required General Skill Set:</u> Communications, mathematics, teamwork, time management.<br>
		<u>Required IT Skillset:</u> Data analysis, statistical analysis, machine learning, understanding of algorithms</p>
		<p>The required general skill set is something that I need to make an effort to work towards every day. Social skills such as communication and teamwork are skills that have to be sharpened in the long run and it’s not something that I can study or pull all-nighters for. These skills are highly sought after and would be beneficial to me - not just in the workplace but in building meaningful relationships with colleagues and business associates. My comprehension of mathematics and time-management skills are weak, and it's something that I have always wanted to improve on. A strong foundation in mathematics will help me in my required IT skill set, especially in data and statistical analysis.</p>
		<p>The required information technology skills are skills that take years of experience in the information technology industry to master, but I’m passionate about my subjects of interest and I’m determined to work hard to achieve my goals. Many start-ups are looking for machine-learning engineers in order to develop their Artificial Intelligence technologies, since the AI industry is currently blowing up. These jobs require a strong understanding of algorithms and data analysis, and I hope that I can stay motivated enough to be able to contribute to the growing developments in Artificial Intelligence, especially in utilising AI to make healthcare more accessible and effective.</p>

		<p>A pen tester, fun to say, hard to execute. Short for penetrations tester, these professionals poke and prod at the safeties and privacy of any programs, firms, or websites. Often referred to as ethical hackers, they perform regular security procedures to explore any weak points in a company’s network, hoping to mitigate any real damage before actual cyber-attacks take place.</p>
		<p>Pen testers have an important job, in this growing world of online technologies, closing possible attack routes is the best way to mitigate any hacking threats. However, many companies leave this sort of work to their own IT departments and will only rely on pen testers after a hack has taken place.</p>
		<p>IT jobs in general are on the rise, according to Burning Glass, cybersecurity job postings have grown 74% from 2007 – 2013. A growth rate of over double when compared to other IT jobs (33%). With this being projected to rise further as the years go on.</p>

	<title1><b>IT WORK</b><title1>
		</head>
		<p> We were able to sit down and have a brief chat with a couple of professionals in the workforce who work predominately with IT.<br>
		We asked them all the same questions, just to get an idea of what the IT professional does in their respective field.</p>
		<p> Our first participant for our interview is S.L., a Digital Engineer, working primarily with the construction industry. Despite the usual manual nature of the field it has recently expanded and grown further into the IT world, incorporating many tools and softwares to assist in their tasks.</p>
		<p> 1. <i>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</i></p>
		<p>S.L.: "I use software, such as Autodesk REVIT, Navisworks, Revizto, ArcGIS, LumenRT, Steam VR,VIVE VR, HoloLens, Bentley Microstation, Microsoft Office Suite, Adobe Suite with and understanding of Earth Volumetric Studio, AutoCAD, and other various modelling tools.<br>
		I use these software to do a variety of tasks: Revit, Navisworks, Revitzo, ArcGIS, and Bentley Microstation to aid in the Building Information Modelling/ Management (BIM) process. This constitutes of aiding clients better manage their assets through 3D modelling and to optimise their workflow for benefit realisation. Every day is different, for example, when a client wants to try AR/VR for infrastructure asset management, the team thinks pair share and learns to gain a better understanding of LumenRT, SteamVR, Revitzo and Microstation either through the HoloLens or VIVE to present and teach to the client."</p>
		<p>2. <i>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</i></p>
		<p>S.L.: "Clients in both private and public sector, BIM manager, digital engineering and assets leader, BIM leader, spatial engineers, architects, transport engineers, marketing leaders, business analysts, project managers, construct teams… but mostly the IT helpdesk."</p>
		<p>3. <i>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</i></p>
		<p>S.L.: "Office or working from home. In front of multiple computer screens."</p>
		<p>4. <i>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</i><p>
		<p>S.L.: "Learning new technology as it arises. With each new version of every software brings stronger headaches and migraines. Waiting for IT helpdesk to resolve some computer and admin issues really tests my patience."</p>

	<title2>Machine Learning<title2>

		<p>Machine learning is a form of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data. The main goal of machine learning is to allow computers to learn from their mistakes and repeat successful outcomes as well as improving their accuracy, without being programmed to do so. Machine learning is becoming increasingly integrated with our daily lives and activities – an example of this is Netflix’s recommendation engine. Netflix recommends users watch similar shows and movies using machine learning to analyse users’ streaming history and habits to predict what the user will potentially enjoy.</p>
		<p>Algorithms play a fundamental role in machine learning, as it is a set of statistical processing steps (IBM Cloud Education, 2020). In simpler terms, it can also be defined as a set of specific procedures to solve a computational problem. In order for machine learning models to function, it has to possess a well-defined and impressive algorithm. Every year, new algorithms are presented in different fields such as Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing, which advances the program and increases the accuracy rate.</p>
		<p>An example of this can be seen with Megatron-LM’s Language Modelling algorithm. Language modelling is the statistical task of predicting words/sentences based on the previous/existing words, and is a branch in the Natural Language Processing field. The Megatron-LM model and paper were first presented in 2019 by Nvidia, and equipped the Transformer Network. Unlike other fields, the NLP doesn’t use accuracy rate to analyse their algorithms but rather its perplexity rate. A good language model will assign high probabilities to real, syntactically sentences and low probabilities to fake, grammatically incorrect sentences. If a model can assign high probabilities to the test set, it means that it is not perplexed by it, resulting in a low perplexity rate. The Megatron-LM model was able to beat the previous state-of-the-art of 15.8 perplexity rate by achieving a 10.8 test perplexity rate whilst analysing a dataset.</p>
