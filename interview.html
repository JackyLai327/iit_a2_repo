            <p>We were able to sit down and have a brief chat with a couple of professionals in the workforce who work predominately with IT.<br>
            We asked them all the same questions, just to get an idea of what the IT professional does in their respective field.</p>
            <p> Our first participant for our interview is S. L., a Digital Engineer, working primarily with the construction industry. Despite the usual manual nature of the field it has recently expanded and grown further into the IT world, incorporating many tools and softwares to assist in their tasks.</p>
            <p>Our second participant for our interview is A. I. He is a graduate Monash University who is working in the IT industry as a software engineer.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class = "question"> 1. <i><b>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</b></i></p>
            <p class = "initials">SL: "I use software, such as Autodesk REVIT, Navisworks, Revizto, ArcGIS, LumenRT, Steam VR,VIVE VR, HoloLens, Bentley Microstation, Microsoft Office Suite, Adobe Suite with and understanding of Earth Volumetric Studio, AutoCAD, and other various modelling tools.<br>
            I use these software to do a variety of tasks: Revit, Navisworks, Revitzo, ArcGIS, and Bentley Microstation to aid in the Building Information Modelling/ Management (BIM) process. This constitutes of aiding clients better manage their assets through 3D modelling and to optimise their workflow for benefit realisation. Every day is different, for example, when a client wants to try AR/VR for infrastructure asset management, the team thinks pair share and learns to gain a better understanding of LumenRT, SteamVR, Revitzo and Microstation either through the HoloLens or VIVE to present and teach to the client."</p>
            <p class = "initials">AI: Currently I am a Junior Software Engineer at my workplace. Our daily jobs consist of writing code – whether it is adding a new feature or fixing a bug. My company is a solutions provider for healthcare. We simplify the process of a company’s HR to submit medical claims, for their employees to check in to clinics/hospitals. As well as simplifying the process for the clinics and hospitals themselves. Apart from writing code, we also do code reviews. All team members review and test out the code written by other members before the solution goes live. This is to ensure that the feature works properly and/or the bug has been fixed. It is also to ensure that no additional issues arise due to the newly written code.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class = "question">2. <i><b>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</b></i></p>
            <p class = "initials">SL: "Clients in both private and public sector, BIM manager, digital engineering and assets leader, BIM leader, spatial engineers, architects, transport engineers, marketing leaders, business analysts, project managers, construct teams… but mostly the IT helpdesk."</p>
            <p class = "initials">AI: Our team works very closely with the Product Team of the company. Since they are the ones who provide the blueprints and ideas to improve our system. My team consists of people from all different kinds of backgrounds. We have Malays, Chinese, Indians, as well as people from other countries – all very well versed in the field of IT. Due to my position, I personally do not have any interactions with them. Most of the time it is spent on actual code writing. Other times it will be spent on investigating bug reports that have come in from clients. </p>
            <hr>
            <p class = "question">3. <i><b>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</b></i></p>
            <p class = "initials">SL: "Office or working from home. In front of multiple computer screens."</p>
            <hr>
            <p class = "question">4. <i><b>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</b></i><p>
            <p class = "initials">SL: "Learning new technology as it arises. With each new version of every software brings stronger headaches and migraines. Waiting for IT helpdesk to resolve some computer and admin issues really tests my patience."</p>
