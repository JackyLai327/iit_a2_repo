            <p> We were able to sit down and have a brief chat with a couple of professionals in the workforce who work predominately with IT.<br>
            We asked them all the same questions, just to get an idea of what the IT professional does in their respective field.</p>
            <p> Our first participant for our interview is S.L., a Digital Engineer, working primarily with the construction industry. Despite the usual manual nature of the field it has recently expanded and grown further into the IT world, incorporating many tools and softwares to assist in their tasks.</p>
            <p> 1. <i>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</i></p>
            <p>S.L.: "I use software, such as Autodesk REVIT, Navisworks, Revizto, ArcGIS, LumenRT, Steam VR,VIVE VR, HoloLens, Bentley Microstation, Microsoft Office Suite, Adobe Suite with and understanding of Earth Volumetric Studio, AutoCAD, and other various modelling tools.<br>
            I use these software to do a variety of tasks: Revit, Navisworks, Revitzo, ArcGIS, and Bentley Microstation to aid in the Building Information Modelling/ Management (BIM) process. This constitutes of aiding clients better manage their assets through 3D modelling and to optimise their workflow for benefit realisation. Every day is different, for example, when a client wants to try AR/VR for infrastructure asset management, the team thinks pair share and learns to gain a better understanding of LumenRT, SteamVR, Revitzo and Microstation either through the HoloLens or VIVE to present and teach to the client."</p>
            <p>2. <i>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</i></p>
            <p>S.L.: "Clients in both private and public sector, BIM manager, digital engineering and assets leader, BIM leader, spatial engineers, architects, transport engineers, marketing leaders, business analysts, project managers, construct teamsâ€¦ but mostly the IT helpdesk."</p>
            <p>3. <i>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</i></p>
            <p>S.L.: "Office or working from home. In front of multiple computer screens."</p>
            <p>4. <i>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</i><p>
            <p>S.L.: "Learning new technology as it arises. With each new version of every software brings stronger headaches and migraines. Waiting for IT helpdesk to resolve some computer and admin issues really tests my patience."</p>
