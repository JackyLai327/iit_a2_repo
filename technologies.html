            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>

            <p>Machine learning is a form of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data. The main goal of machine learning is to allow computers to learn from their mistakes and repeat successful outcomes as well as improving their accuracy, without being programmed to do so. Machine learning is becoming increasingly integrated with our daily lives and activities – an example of this is Netflix’s recommendation engine. Netflix recommends users watch similar shows and movies using machine learning to analyse users’ streaming history and habits to predict what the user will potentially enjoy.</p>
			<p>Algorithms play a fundamental role in machine learning, as it is a set of statistical processing steps (IBM Cloud Education, 2020). In simpler terms, it can also be defined as a set of specific procedures to solve a computational problem. In order for machine learning models to function, it has to possess a well-defined and impressive algorithm. Every year, new algorithms are presented in different fields such as Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing, which advances the program and increases the accuracy rate.</p>
			<p>An example of this can be seen with Megatron-LM’s Language Modelling algorithm. Language modelling is the statistical task of predicting words/sentences based on the previous/existing words, and is a branch in the Natural Language Processing field. The Megatron-LM model and paper were first presented in 2019 by Nvidia, and equipped the Transformer Network. Unlike other fields, the NLP doesn’t use accuracy rate to analyse their algorithms but rather its perplexity rate. A good language model will assign high probabilities to real, syntactically sentences and low probabilities to fake, grammatically incorrect sentences. If a model can assign high probabilities to the test set, it means that it is not perplexed by it, resulting in a low perplexity rate. The Megatron-LM model was able to beat the previous state-of-the-art of 15.8 perplexity rate by achieving a 10.8 test perplexity rate whilst analysing a dataset.</p>

			<h3>Near and Future Expectations and Impacts</h3>
			<p>The impacts of this state of the art technology implies that soon, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning working hand in hand will allow them to develop stories using language modelling or even novels. The previous state-of-the-art technology for language modelling, GPT-2 was able to create a short story based on a two-sentence prompt from its scientists (OpenAI, 2019). Currently, language modelling software can only produce stories and articles based on the prompts given to them by their data sets, however it is possible that we can eventually equip this technology to write daily news articles.</p>
			<p>Although this proves that machine learning can yield creative results, there are negative impacts of releasing this software to the general public. An example of this can be seen with Microsoft’s “Tay'' which was a twitter bot that replies based on interactions with twitter users. Users replied with offensive remarks and statements, poisoning the dataset the bot “learns” and causing it to create offensive remarks (Solaiman et al. 2019).</p>
			<p>Releasing this software to the general public could trigger a similar situation, causing biases in the data set. The impacts of machine learning extend far beyond Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, as other sectors such as healthcare and finance have been keen to equip this technology (Quantilus, 2020). Gurovich et al., theorizes that AI will soon allow researchers to perform an in-depth analysis on genetic diseases using predictive data models. Deep learning models will be able to provide real-time insights and help healthcare professionals diagnose patients more accurately and efficiently. </p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h3>How will this afftct you?</h3>
			<p>Although the analysis above mostly focused on its impacts in Natural Language Processing, machine learning is an integral part of many artificial intelligence-based branches. Scientists have been experimenting with machine learning in many branches, such as healthcare, banking and entertainment.</p>
			<p>However, the current public’s perception of artificial intelligence and its technology is fearful - they believe that this technology will replace manual labor and increase unemployment rates. This fear is not without reason, as low wage employees have been increasingly replaced with robots during the pandemic (Semuels, 2020).</p>
			<p>Although the reason for this was to reduce the health risks of workers during the pandemic, many companies have decided to permanently implement these machines instead of hiring low-wage employees such as janitors, toll collectors and cashiers in order to reduce costs and maximise efficiency. However, I believe the implementation of artificial intelligence in these fields will also create more job opportunities such as machine learning engineers and data scientists, both fields which are currently experiencing an increasingly high demand.</p>

			<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>

			<p>Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that the software systems and artificial intelligence take partial or full control of the car whereas human drivers can trust the vehicle for their safety. This type of cars mostly rely on different sensors installed inside and outside the vehicle, and software of control, navigating, and driving. In the 21st Century, many autonomous vehicles are expected to perform speed control, driving and parking assistance, braking control, obstacle detection, alerts of other vehicles, and monitoring of operating conditions. For efficiency and Safety, there are electronic controllers which are designed for airbag control, autonomous braking system, and even stability control, auto pilot for higher level autonomous vehicles.</p>
			<p>Nowadays, autonomous cars are divided into 6 levels of autonomy, where level 0 being no autonomy, level 1 shows specific systems like cruise control or auto brake and auto control one at a time, level 2 shows at least two simultaneous auto functions like accelerating and steering, when humans are required for safety functions, level 3 being the vehicle managing safety functions under certain conditions and the drivers only take over when alerted, level 4 goes full autonomous in some scenarios but not all, and level 5 being full auto under any circumstances. Our most advanced technology has achieved level 3 autonomy so far and will continue to level up in the future.</p>
			<p>Although there seem to be numerous benefits of driving an autonomous vehicle, there are concerns created by these products. First of all, autonomous cars nowadays are pretty expensive compared to traditional cars. These cars are sometimes unaffordable for a lot of people. Despite the financial challenges, moral and ethical problems are also remaining unsolvable. It is pointless to blame a car or an AI system for car accidents, making it hard to define who is responsible for the accidents when driving an autonomous vehicle. Furthermore, there is no law enforcement to define AI robots and full-auto vehicles for now. These problems are scary and most people wouldn’t spend a big fortune on uncertain dangers.</p>
			
			<hr>

			<h3>What does it do? Near Future Expectations</h3>
			<p>While there are companies producing the prototype of full autonomy cars, it is anticipated that level 4 autonomous vehicles shall come to the world in maybe two to three coming years. With that development progress, autonomous vehicles are expected to be much more common in the future 10 to 20 years and even transform into public transportations.</p>
			<p>Although the development of these types of cars can cost tons of money and resources, the price of autonomous vehicles shall drop as technology evolves and more AI are being implemented. It is also a vision that more and more auto cars will be on the road when technology is becoming more affordable and more acceptable by the majority of people around the globe. Some people might worry about unemployment of all sorts but it is nothing to think about for at least 10 years before the governments and enterprises work out the best restrictions and policies for AI autonomous vehicles.</p>
			
			<hr>

			<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
			<p>As time moves forward and technology grows, impacts of good and bad are predicted. There are indeed many advantages that auto cars can bring to people’s lives. It is unquestionable that the vast majority of road accidents that include cars are stemmed from human errors, human emotions, or delayed reaction time in humans’ brains.</p>
			<p>Due to this reason, many researchers and companies believe that more autonomous vehicles on road implies less traffic accidents and higher road safety. When human performances are removed for most cars on the road, less unseen danger there is. Speaking of humans, disabled people are no less to be considered about.</p>
			<p>For the minority community, many of them are not capable of driving cars and other types of vehicles even if they are mentally stable to perform the tasks. Full autonomous cars may bring huge convenience among those people and remove a certain degree of discrimination against physically challenged friends. Beside, it is no doubt that autonomous cars will bring higher productivity and performances in the workplace when fewer people need to worry about different ways of commuting or being stuck in a traffic congestion.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, when full auto cars are common enough to take over people’s jobs, it is time to worry about unemployment. For people thinking unemployment is terrifying enough, there is more to come. Full autonomous vehicles are like computers, there are always loopholes to hack into it. If hackers successfully hack into the systems, there could lead to a higher rate of cybercrime when stealing, robbing, kidnapping, and murdering become similar to hacking a computer.</p>
			
			<hr>

			<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
			<p>The above mentioned impacts are not for one person or a single company. It is influencing millions and millions of people around the world. When full auto is online, motor industries include brands, factories, technicians, and engineers will change the traditional works and potentially lose their jobs.</p>
			<p>In addition, those people are not the one who may be fired, most Taxi and Uber drivers will probably be replaced by AI systems if autonomous vehicles become a trend in the future. This does not mean that auto cars only affect people in a depressing way.</p>
			<p>People affected by this also include people who were not allowed to drive due to physical challenges, age, wealth like disabled people, children, and the ones who are financially challenged. The commuters may also change a way of going to work, and wealthy people may have different collections of cars and fire their personal drivers. Nevertheless, the security industries shall strive and make bigger progress on preventing viruses or hackers getting into autonomous vehicles and harming others’ properties.</p>
			<p>Of course there are also effects on us and our everyday lives. In the future, we may see autonomous cars ubiquitous on the road and get used to the drivers putting makeup on in the pilot seat when autonomous cars are cheaper and cheaper. Our Uber might as well be taken over by AI systems and we could worry less about road safety concerns about car accidents or driver harassments. Of course we do not want to see lazy people forgetting how to drive and that’s when we should worry about whether full auto is really beneficial or not.</p>

			<h2>Natural Language Processing and ChatterBots</h2>

			<p>Natural language processing is a computer technology that accepts user input in the form of natural language, and internally performs a series of operations such as processing and calculation through algorithms defined by humans to simulate human understanding of natural language and return the results that users expect. The purpose of natural language processing is to use computers instead of humans to process large-scale natural language information.</p>
			<p>Natural Language processing technology covers a wide range of the industry. For all industries that apply information technology, such as banking, consulting, hospitals, publishing, manufacturing, film and television, etc., their common characteristics are all dependent on information and information systems. Computer software and hardware, the Internet, and various other network environments that link to all the above things, the personnel engaged in the design, maintenance, support, and management together form a ubiquitous IT industry.</p>
			
			<hr>

			<h3>What does it do? Near Future Expectations</h3>
			<p>The function of most chatbots includes information acquisition, storage, processing, a high level of decision-making ability thereby improving or enhancing people's life quality. Nowadays, more chatbot appears to solve people's problems, the most of market chatbot can be done:<br>
			1. Customer service. In order to ensure service quality, many Internet companies need to establish a huge customer service team to handle returns, complaints, consultations and other things. The characteristics of these things are repetitive. The work of tens of thousands of customer service staff who answer every day is to Find the corresponding event handling method according to something like an "operation manual", these are precisely things that the robot can solve without any effort.<br>
			2. Assistant People have been trying hard to create personal electronic assistants, like Siri and Cortana. It helps to deal with some mechanical things that do not require much decision-making, can understand the commands expressed in human spoken language, and perform a series of operations.<br>
			3. The SMS query service of the conversation UI operator. For example, if you want to see how much credit you have, credit card bills, text messages, you only need to enter simple keywords such as phone bills and bills, and you will receive the required information.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, the smart home robot(Google Home and Alexa) is equivalent to a control system in the smart home, compatible with multiple communication protocols. The smart home robot, as its name implies, can control various smart home devices, including smart switches, smart curtains, smart cameras, etc., and can also control door locks. Air conditioners, televisions and other household appliances act according to verbal instructions. The assistant robot-like  It also helps to deal with some mechanical things that do not require much decision-making, can understand the commands expressed in human spoken language, and perform a series of operations.</p>
			
			<hr>

			<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
			<p>Although the emergence of artificial intelligence has played a good role in guiding people to process and save information, and the speed of processing and saving information will be faster than before, these still have an impact. The main concern among security experts when it comes to smart home devices is the degree to which they are listening. They obviously listen for any commands the user might utter, but what it takes to may put privacy at risk(Brenner 2017).</p>
			
			<hr>

			<h3>How will this effect you?</h3>
			<p>The chatterbots amazon Alexa/ google home greatly simplifies our time housework. It has a great influence on the group of office workers who have no time for doing housework. When Instruction received we can spare time to do other meaningful things. In the past, we spent a lot of time and energy doing housework, which made us exhausted.</p>
			<p>Now As long as he is connected to the Internet, he moves his fingers and even adjusts to automatic mode. Also, chatterbots amazon Alexa/ google home can adjust the temperature and humidity of the home according to your settings, and it can be automatically controlled. In summer, we can open the door of our home and we can be comfortable. In the environment, there is no need to turn on the air conditioner and wait. We can set the cooling mode of the air conditioner to be turned on 2 kilometres away from the home so that when we get home, we don’t have to sweat like outside.</p>

			<h2>Robots</h2>

			<p>Robots have various definitions depending on which roboticist you’re asking. However, everyone agrees on several defining characteristics of a robot. A robot is an intelligent, physically embodied machine that is autonomous to some degree and can sense and manipulate its environment (Simon, 2020).</p>
			<p>For example, a simple drone that you can pilot around wouldn’t be considered a robot. But give it the ability to take off and land by itself and detect objects, and it’s a robot. These show elements of autonomy and sensing.</p>
			<p>It wasn’t until the 1960s that the first robot with perception was made. Soon after that, robot arms were introduced which led to advancement of automobile manufacturing. In 2004, a team of roboticists created self-driving cars using technology called Lidar which shoots out lasers to build a 3-D map of the world.</p>
			<p>Later on, lidar was combined with machine vision which utilised 2-D or 3-D cameras to build an even better picture of its world. Facial recognition works in a similar way, algorithms allow help pick out landmarks or objects. Machine vision also allows robots to scan cherry trees to determine where to best shake them, thus increasing efficiency in agriculture. At MIT, researchers developed a system that allows robots to see around corners, this could mean minimizing crashes.</p>
			<p>Despite these technological advancements in robotics, for robots to actually be useful, they need to become more self-sufficient. And for this to happen, a lot more research has to be done. It is impossible to program a robot with instructions to do every single thing. That is where advances in AI and machine learning come in, we need robots to learn on their own. For example, a humanoid robot at the UC Berkeley lab trained itself to fit different shaped pegs into different holes through trial and error and reinforcement learning. Despite robots getting smarter every day, we still need to babysit then at least in the near future.</p>
			<p>Robots have three main technologies to thank: sensors, actuators and Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Simon, 2020). Sensors keep the robots from smashing into things and to navigate. Actuators are devices that cause motion in robots. While getting more physically robust, robots are also getting smarter, thanks to AI.</p>
			
			<hr>

			<h3>What does it do? Near Future Expectations</h3>
			<p>The revolution of robotics is rapidly accelerating, from electric machines that performed repetitive tasks to automobile manufacturing, AI and machine learning. In the past two decades, the use of robots has multiplied three-fold (Tarver, 2020). </p>
			<p>With the boost in productivity and economic growth, brings the creation of new jobs but also the disruption and loss of existing jobs. By 2030, it is estimated that up to 20 million manufacturing jobs will be lost to robots (Tarver, 2020). It is worrying that a robot might steal your job, but this is capitalism and automation is inevitable. Fortunately, the loss of existing jobs will also lead to new jobs like manufacturing robots and working alongside robots.</p>
			<p>The ‘second wave’ of robots has started to create robots that don’t just perform simple tasks but also absorb data and respond to new information so that they can self-learn. These robots currently play major roles in the healthcare, defence and public safety, manufacturing and mining industries (Tarver, 2020).</p>
			<p>The development of medical robots has meant that human medical workers no longer have to do the dull, unsanitary, dangerous work and risk falling ill. Robots could help take patients’ temperatures and deliver drugs, for example.</p>
			<p>Surgical robots such as the Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci are able to perform minimally invasive prostatectomies and aid in other procedures. With the help of robots and machines, human medical workers have more time to problem solve, interact with and be empathetic towards their patients. These skills can never be replicated by a robot. Due to the pandemic, the demand for telemedicine has skyrocketed due to the lack of resources and manpower.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, we still need humans to do the jobs that require that human touch. Now we have to figure out how to manage the responsibility of having invented a whole new species of robots.</p>
			
			<hr>

			<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
			<p>At an individual level, ways in which robots can help include but are not limited to getting from one place to another, minimising accidents, drones can be first responders to accidents, provide reconnaissance, battlefield support, and sentry duty. This will fill in gaps such as the lack of manpower and even reduce the overall cost. People can focus more on the more meaningful things in life, perhaps even have less work and hence more time to spend working on their mental health and exploring their other interests.</p>
