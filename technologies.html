            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>


            <p>Machine learning is a form of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on building systems that self-learn from data collected. The main goal of machine learning is to allow computers to learn from their mistakes and successful attempts as well as improving their accuracy, without being programmed to do so specifically. Machine learning is becoming increasingly integrated with our daily lives and activities – an example of this is Netflix’s recommendation engine. Netflix utilizes machine learning to recommend users similar shows and movies by analyzing users’ streaming history and habits to predict what the user will potentially enjoy.
			</p>
			<p>Algorithms play a fundamental role in machine learning, as it is a set of statistical processing steps (IBM Cloud Education, 2020). In simpler terms, it can also be defined as a set of specific procedures to solve a computational problem. In order for machine learning models to function, it has to possess a well-defined and impressive algorithm. Every year, new algorithms are presented in different fields such as Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing (NLP), which improves the program and increases the accuracy rate. 
			</p>
			<p>An example of this can be seen with Megatron-LM’s Language Modelling algorithm. Language modelling is the statistical task of predicting words/sentences based on the previous/existing words and is a branch in the NLP field. The Megatron-LM model and paper were first presented in 2019 by Nvidia and supported the Transformer Network. Unlike other fields, NLP does not use accuracy rate to analyze their algorithms but rather its perplexity rate. A good language model will assign high probabilities to real, syntactically sentences and low probabilities to fake, grammatically incorrect sentences. If a model can assign high probabilities to the test set, it means that it is not perplexed by it, resulting in a low perplexity rate. The Megatron-LM model was able to beat the previous state-of-the-art of 15.8 perplexity rate by achieving a 10.8 test perplexity rate whilst analyzing a dataset. 
			</p>

			<h3>Near and Future Expectations and Impacts</h3>
			<p>This state-of-the-art technology implies that soon, with the collaboration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, stories or perhaps even novels can be developed using language modelling. The previous state-of-the-art technology for language modelling, GPT-2 was able to create a short story based on a two-sentence prompt from its scientists (OpenAI, 2019). Currently, language modelling software can only produce stories and articles based on the prompts given to them by their data sets, however it is possible that we can eventually see this new technology write daily news articles.</p>
			<p>Although this proves that machine learning can yield creative results, there are negative impacts of releasing this software to the general public. An example of this can be seen with Microsoft’s “Tay'' which was a twitter bot that replies based on its interactions with twitter users. Users replied with offensive remarks and statements, poisoning the dataset, the bot “learns” which leads to the creation of offensive remarks (Solaiman et al., 2019). </p>
			<p>Releasing this software to the general public could trigger a similar scenario, causing biases in the data set. The impacts of machine learning extend far beyond Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, as other sectors such as healthcare and finance have been keen to equip this technology (Quantilus, 2020). Gurovich et al. (2018), theorizes that AI will soon allow researchers to perform an in-depth analysis of genetic diseases using predictive data models. Deep learning models will be able to provide real-time insights and help healthcare professionals diagnose patients more accurately and efficiently. </p>

			<h3>How will this afftct you?</h3>
			<p>Although the analysis above mostly focuses on its impacts in Natural Language Processing, machine learning is an integral part of many artificial intelligence-based branches. Scientists have been experimenting with machine learning in many areas, such as healthcare, banking and entertainment.</p>
			<p>However, the general public’s consensus is that they fear artificial intelligence and technology - they believe that this technology will replace manual labor and increase unemployment rates. This fear is not without reason, as low wage employees have been increasingly replaced with robots during the pandemic (Semuels, 2020).</p>
			<p>Although the reason for this was to reduce the health risks of workers during the pandemic, many companies have decided to permanently implement these machines instead of hiring low-wage employees such as janitors, toll collectors and cashiers in order to reduce costs and maximize efficiency. However, I believe the implementation of artificial intelligence in these fields will also create more job opportunities such as machine learning engineers and data scientists, both fields which are currently experiencing an increase in demand.

			<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>

			<p>Autonomous vehicles are vehicles where drivers can rely on the vehicle for its safety as software systems and artificial intelligence take partial or full control of the car. These types of cars mostly rely on different sensors installed inside and outside the vehicle, software that enable control, navigation and driving. In the 21st Century, many autonomous vehicles are expected to perform speed control, driving and parking assistance, braking control, obstacle detection, alerts of other vehicles and monitoring of operating conditions. For efficiency and safety, there are electronic controllers which are designed for airbag control, an autonomous braking system, stability control and even auto pilot for higher level autonomous vehicles. </p>
			<p>Autonomous cars are divided into 6 levels of autonomy, where level 0 being no autonomy, level 1 shows specific systems like cruise control or auto brake and auto control one at a time, level 2 shows at least two simultaneous auto functions like accelerating and steering, when humans are required for safety functions, level 3 being the vehicle managing safety functions under certain conditions and the drivers only take over when alerted, level 4 goes full autonomous in some scenarios but not all, and level 5 being full auto under all circumstances. Our most advanced technology has achieved level 3 autonomy so far and will continue to level up in the future. </p>
			<p>Although there seems to be numerous benefits of driving an autonomous vehicle, there are concerns with this type of technological advancements. First of all, autonomous cars are expensive compared to traditional cars. These cars are inaccessible for the majority of people. Other than these financial barriers, moral and ethical issues have been debated. It is pointless to blame a car or an AI system for car accidents, making it hard to define who is responsible for the accidents when driving an autonomous vehicle. Furthermore, there is no law or policies to define what constitutes an AI robot and full-auto vehicles for now. These problems are scary, and most people would be hesitant to spend a large sum of money on something that poses a potential threat to their safety and morals.</p>
		
			<h3>What does it do? Near Future Expectations</h3>
			<p>While there are companies producing prototypes of fully autonomous cars, it is anticipated that level 4 autonomous vehicles will arrive in the next few years. With that progress, autonomous vehicles are expected to be much more common in the next 10 to 20 years and even be implemented in the public transport sector. </p>
			<p>Although the development of these vehicles is costly, the price of autonomous vehicles will drop as technology evolves and more AI is implemented. It is also a vision that more auto cars will be on the road when technology becomes more affordable and more accepted worldwide. Some people worry about unemployment, but it is nothing to worry about since governments and enterprises will work out the best restrictions and policies for AI autonomous vehicles. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
			<p>As we move forward and technology advances, positive and negative impacts are to be anticipated. There are indeed many advantages that auto cars bring to the table. It is unquestionable that the vast majority of road accidents are stemmed from human errors such as emotions or delayed reaction time.</p>
			<p>Due to this, many researchers and companies believe that more autonomous vehicles on the road implies less traffic accidents and higher road safety. Speaking of humans, disabled people are given little consideration. Being the minority, many of them are not capable of driving cars and other types of vehicles even if they are mentally stable to do so. Fully autonomous cars would allow such people to get around in a convenient and safe manner without the help of others. Besides, there is no doubt that autonomous cars will increase productivity and performance in the workplace when there is no need to worry about being stuck in traffic due to accidents. </p>
			<p>On the other hand, when full auto cars are common enough to take over people’s jobs, it is time to worry about unemployment. Fully autonomous vehicles are like computers, there will always loopholes to hack into. If hackers can successfully hack into the vehicles systems, this could lead to an increase of cybercrime to assist in stealing, robbing, kidnapping and murdering people.
			</p>
			
			<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
			<p>The above-mentioned impacts are not for one person or a single company. It influences millions of people around the world. When fully autonomous vehicles are successfully implemented and more accessible, motor industries including factories, technicians and engineers will potentially lose their jobs or at best there would be a decrease in demand for these jobs. In addition, most taxi drivers will be replaced by AI. This does not mean that auto cars only have negative impacts. People affected by this also include people who were previously unable to drive due to physical limitations, age, wealth and children. Nevertheless, the security industry will create more jobs as they will require more IT professionals to safeguard against viruses or hackers. When taxi drivers are taken over by AI systems, we will worry less about road safety and even harassment from drivers.</p>

			<h2>Natural Language Processing and ChatterBots</h2>

			<p>Natural language processing is technology that registers user input in the form of language, and internally performs a series of operations such as processing and calculation through algorithms created by humans to simulate a human understanding of language and return the results that users require. The purpose of natural language processing is to use computers instead of humans to process large-scale natural language information.
			</p>
			<p>Natural Language processing can be utilized in many industries. Industries that apply information technology, such as banking, consulting, hospitals, publishing, manufacturing, film and television, are all dependent on information and information systems. Computer software and hardware, the Internet, and various other network environments that link to all the above, the personnel engaged in the design, maintenance, support, and management together form a ubiquitous IT industry.
			</p>
			
			<h3>What does it do? Near Future Expectations</h3>
			<p>The common functions of chatbots include information acquisition, storage, processing, a high level of decision-making ability thereby improving or enhancing people's quality of life. Chatbots can solve many problems including:
			<br />
			1. Customer service. In order to ensure quality service, many Internet companies need to have a huge customer service team to handle returns, complaints, consultations and other things. The work of thousands of customer service staff are things that chatbots can solve without minimal effort.
			<br />
			2. Assistants like Siri and Cortana. These helps manage issues that do not require much decision-making. They can understand the commands expressed in human language and perform a series of operations to provide an answer for the user.
			<br />
			3. SMS query service through a conversation UI operator. For example, if you want to see how much credit you have, credit card bills, text messages, you only need to enter a few simple keywords such as phone bills and bills, and you will receive the information you require.
			<br />
			4. Smart home robots (Google Home and Alexa) are equivalent to a control system in the smart home, compatible with multiple communication protocols. The smart home robot, as its name implies, can control various smart home devices, including smart switches, smart curtains, smart cameras and can also control door locks. Air conditioners, televisions and other household appliances will act according to verbal instructions.
			</p>
			
			<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
			<p>Although the emergence of artificial intelligence has played a large role in helping people process and save information, the speed of processing and saving information will be faster than ever before. The main concern among security experts when it comes to smart home devices is the degree to which they are listening. Do they listen to more than what the user commands and requests? (Brenner, 2017).
			</p>
			
			<h3>How will this effect you?</h3>
			<p>Chatterbots such as Alexa and Google home save a lot of time. It helps working professionals save time on small tasks. This means we can spend time doing other meaningful things. Also, chatterbots like Alexa/Google home can adjust the temperature and humidity of the home according to your settings, and it can be easily controlled from a distance, even when we aren’t at home.</p>

			<h2>Robots</h2>

			<p>Robots have various definitions depending on which roboticist you’re asking. However, everyone agrees on several defining characteristics of a robot. A robot is an intelligent, physically embodied machine that is autonomous to some degree and can sense and manipulate its environment (Simon, 2020). For example, a simple drone that you can pilot around wouldn’t be considered a robot. But give it the ability to take off and land by itself and detect objects, and it’s a robot. These show elements of autonomy and sensing.
			</p>
			<p>It wasn’t until the 1960s that the first robot with perception was made. Soon after that, robot arms were introduced which led to advancement of automobile manufacturing. In 2004, a team of roboticists created self-driving cars using technology called Lidar which shoots out lasers to build a 3-D map of the world. Later on, lidar was combined with machine vision which utilized 2-D or 3-D cameras to build an even better picture of its world. Facial recognition works in a similar way, algorithms allow help pick out landmarks or objects. Machine vision also allows robots to scan cherry trees to determine where to best shake them, thus increasing efficiency in agriculture. At MIT, researchers developed a system that allows robots to see around corners, this could mean minimizing crashes.</p>
			<p>Despite these technological advancements in robotics, for robots to actually be useful, they need to become more self-sufficient. And for this to happen, a lot more research has to be done. It is impossible to program a robot with instructions to do every single thing. That is where advances in AI and machine learning come in, we need robots to learn on their own. For example, a humanoid robot at the UC Berkeley lab trained itself to fit different shaped pegs into different holes through trial and error and reinforcement learning. Despite robots getting smarter every day, we still need to babysit then at least in the near future.</p>
			<p>Robots have three main technologies to thank: sensors, actuators and Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Simon, 2020). Sensors keep the robots from smashing into things and to navigate. Actuators are devices that cause motion in robots. While getting more physically robust, robots are also getting smarter, thanks to AI.
			</p>
			
			<h3>What does it do? Near Future Expectations</h3>
			<p>The revolution of robotics is rapidly accelerating, from electric machines that performed repetitive tasks to automobile manufacturing, AI and machine learning. In the past two decades, the use of robots has multiplied three-fold (Tarver, 2020). With the boost in productivity and economic growth, brings the creation of new jobs but also the disruption and loss of existing jobs. By 2030, it is estimated that up to 20 million manufacturing jobs will be lost to robots (Tarver, 2020). It is worrying that a robot might steal your job, but this is capitalism and automation is inevitable. Fortunately, the loss of existing jobs will also lead to new jobs like manufacturing robots and working alongside robots.
			</p>
			<p>The ‘second wave’ of robots has started to create robots that don’t just perform simple tasks but also absorb data and respond to new information so that they can self-learn. These robots currently play major roles in the healthcare, defense and public safety, manufacturing and mining industries (Tarver, 2020).</p>
			<p>The development of medical robots has meant that human medical workers no longer have to do the dull, unsanitary, dangerous work and risk falling ill. Robots could help take patients’ temperatures and deliver drugs, for example. Surgical robots such as the Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci are able to perform minimally invasive prostatectomies and aid in other procedures. With the help of robots and machines, human medical workers have more time to problem solve, interact with and be empathetic towards their patients. These skills can never be replicated by a robot. Due to the pandemic, the demand for telemedicine has skyrocketed due to the lack of resources and manpower.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, we still need humans to do the jobs that require that human touch. Now we have to figure out how to manage the responsibility of having invented a whole new species of robots.</p>
			
			<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
			<p>At an individual level, ways in which robots can help include but are not limited to getting from one place to another, minimizing accidents, drones can be first responders to accidents, provide reconnaissance, battlefield support, and sentry duty. This will fill in gaps such as the lack of manpower and even reduce the overall cost. People can focus more on the more meaningful things in life, perhaps even have less work and hence more time to spend working on their mental health and exploring their other interests.</p>
